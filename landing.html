										<h2>Here's a Bit About Myself</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Hello again and thank you for viewing my profile! My name is Jonathan and I am currently a fresh graduate of
									a (BAS) Data Analytics Program, as of December 2021. I have great passion for the field of data and data analysis,
									as I have a natural tendency to want to decipher, analyze, and glean insights from unreadable or organized data. 
									Most of my enjoyment comes from working towards a goal of wanting to know more and these interests extend into 
									data analysis, engineering, and science topics as these roles are all part of one whole.<br />
									<br />
									<h2>Skills</h2>
									<br />
									<b>Python:</b> The language and it's associated libraries for data transformation and manipulation. I have written a fair amount of scripts combined with shell scripts at my current job to periodically collect and clean data. I also have many projects stored on my GitHub that are all written in python, more so for data science (ML and prediction projects) and data engineering.
									<br />
									<b>R:</b> I have acquired skills for this language working with many data analytics projects in schooling.
									<br />
									<b>SQL:</b> I have worked with relational databases, writing query's to draw and store information in mock databases.
									<br />
									<b>SQLite:</b> Utilized in my current position, to query and analyze large amounts of data to generate some form of performance monitoring in python.
									<br />
									<b>JavaScript/HTML/CSS:</b> For my own web development interests I have used this to build a website or two using the react framework.
									<br />
									<b>Power BI and Tableau:</b> Both tools I have used to dashboard results from databases.
									<br />
									<b>SSMS/SSRS/SSIS:</b> I am familiar and have used Sequel Server Management, Reporting, and Integration services in traditional schooling on databases.
									<br />
									<b>Excel:</b> I have the moderate qualifications in transforming and working with excel spreadsheets, to transform legacy data storage to a database.

												<h3>Hobbies</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Like my analytical skills, I have a wide breadth of hobbies, some that I touch basis on more than others.
											</br>
											</br>
											My favorite pastimes are physical activities like: longboarding, hiking, tennis, and working out. Some of the
											hobbies that are more stagnant are: violin, building computers, minimalism, fashion, and making a good cup of coffee.</br>
											</br>
											What I would really like to get into is, guitar, biking, and DIY electronic projects.</p>
